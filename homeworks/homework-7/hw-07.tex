Total points: 10 (reproducibility) + 30 (Q1) = 40 points.\\

\textbf{General instructions for homeworks}: Please follow the uploading
file instructions according to the syllabus. You will give the commands
to answer each question in its own code block, which will also produce
plots that will be automatically embedded in the output file. Each
answer must be supported by written statements as well as any code used.
Your code must be completely reproducible and must compile.

\textbf{Advice}: Start early on the homeworks and it is advised that you
not wait until the day of. While the professor and the TA's check
emails, they will be answered in the order they are received and last
minute help will not be given unless we happen to be free.

\textbf{Commenting code} Code should be commented. See the Google style
guide for questions regarding commenting or how to write code
\url{https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml}. No late homework's
will be accepted.

  For each of the two species, obtain posterior distributions of the
  population mean \theta and covariance matrix \sigma as follows: Using
  the semiconjugate prior distributions for \theta and \sigma, set Î¼0
  equal to the sample mean of the data, 0 and S0 equal to the sample
  covariance matrix and 0 = 4. Obtain 10,000 posterior samples of and .
  Note that this ``prior'' distribution loosely centers the parameters
  around empirical estimates based on the observed data (and is very
  similar to the unit information prior described in the previous
  exercise). It cannot be considered as our true prior distribution, as
  it was derived from the observed data. However, it can be roughly
  considered as the prior distribution of someone with weak but unbiased
  information
